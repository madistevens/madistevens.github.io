            <h2>Assignment Brief</h2>
            <p>
                Develop a community resource centre for the site occupied by the Dufferin-
                King Parkette near the intersection of Dufferin and King St. W. in Toronto. All structures and landscapes shall be replaced by your proposed project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Develop a building, or multi building cluster, with a maximum interior program
                of about 1200m. sq. Situate the building within a landscape plan occupying the
                remainder of the site (approx 3000m.sq.). The proposed building(s) and landscape scheme shall respond to the Dufferin
                streetscape, and may include courtyards, gardens, and other integration of
                interior and exterior environments.The maximum height of any structure is limited to two storeys (+8m) above
                grade, with a basement level maximum one storey (-4m) below grade.
                Projects must include at least two levels.
                In addition to built structures, your project must consider both open green
                landscaped space and street frontage which responds to the neighbourhood
                context.
            </p>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                Our community center at King and Dufferin is designed as a spatial reflection of the intersection between Liberty Village and Parkdale, two
                neighborhoods with distinct identities that have increasingly blended over time. Liberty Village’s history of manufacturing and industrial order and
                Parkdale’s legacy of activism, cultural diversity, and community resilience form the conceptual foundation for the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site is organized around three buildings, each reflecting a point along this cultural spectrum. On the Liberty Village side, forms are rigid and
                linear, featuring parametric brickwork to evoke the area's industrial past in a contemporary way. On the Parkdale side, geometry becomes curved
                and organic, with increased landscape integration and softer spatial boundaries to represent community gathering, care, and expression. The
                central building acts as a mediator, where the two languages merge both spatially and conceptually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Movement through the site is choreographed to support the theme of convergence. Channelized pathways between the buildings create efficient
                flow from the site entrance to a large open green space at the rear. As users move toward this space, the circulation shifts into curved, meandering
                paths, encouraging slowing down, pausing, and informal gathering; mirroring the transition from structured production to social engagement.
